# Altair
### What is Altair visualization?
Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega and Vega-Lite, and the source is available here on GitHub. With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning. This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code.
### Is Altair better than Matplotlib?
If you want to use a declarative style, you might choose altair instead of matplotlib though ggplot also has these characteristics. If you want to make a scatter plot or histogram or something basic like that with as little fuss as possible, you'll probably want to use matplotlib.
### Is Altair better than Plotly?
One notable difference is that Altair will keep plot elements and spacing constant while resizing the plot size to fit e.g. more categorical entries, whereas Plotly will modify spacing and the size of the elements in a plot to fit an overall plot size.
### This project
Shows many ways to use Altair and the steps to get there, enjoy!!
